# CrimeEigen Investigate

CrimeEigen Investigate is a web application developed to assist in identifying suspects from unclear CCTV images using **facial recognition technology**. It employs the **Eigenface method** for facial detection and recognition, comparing suspect images against a pre-established database of known faces. This project was developed as part of a 24-hour hackathon challenge.

## Overview
CrimeEigen Investigate uses facial recognition based on the **Eigenface algorithm** to process CCTV footage and assist law enforcement in identifying potential suspects. By comparing the features of the face in the footage with an existing database, the system provides a list of matches and their probability scores.

## Features
- Facial detection using **OpenCV**.
- Facial recognition using the **Eigenface method**.
- Upload and analyze unclear CCTV images.
- Compare suspect images with a pre-built face database.
- Display matching results with probability scores.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Backend)
- **Flask** (Web framework)
- **OpenCV** (Computer Vision library for image processing)
- **Eigenface** (Algorithm for facial recognition)
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** (Frontend)
- **SQLite/MySQL** (Database for storing faces and metadata)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CrimeEigenInvestigate.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd CrimeEigenInvestigate
    ```
3. Install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
- **Upload an image**: Upload unclear CCTV images to detect and recognize potential faces.
- **View Results**: Once the image is processed, the system will display matching faces from the database, along with probability scores indicating the match likelihood.
